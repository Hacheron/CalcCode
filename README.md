# CalcCode
This Repo is for git/github training purposes.

This Repo contains three files.

1. A java script for a calculator that can only do addition. It can also upload an xml test file with math problems and output and xml file with answers to those math problems
2. A perl script that validates the answers of the output xml file
3. A sample xml file with math problems on it.

Files 1 and 2 could use some updates. Let's make them work for subtraction, multiplication, and division.
